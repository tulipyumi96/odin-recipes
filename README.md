Project #1 Recipe

In this project, I will be creating my very first fully functional html site. I will demonstrate all of the skills I have learned in the Foundations course at Odin. If successful, I will be able to:
- Use the command line to move and edit my directories
- Use VSCode
- Create a website with a good hierarchal visual structure
- Have multiple pages linked to each other
- Be able to upload and resize images
- Be able to properly edit, stage, and commit to Github

This is my very first project and I'm excited to get into it!

For my website, I have decided to take recipes from Dungeon Meshi! The recipes I will be creating are...
- Man Eating Fruit Tart
- Roasted Red Dragon
- Griffin Soup
